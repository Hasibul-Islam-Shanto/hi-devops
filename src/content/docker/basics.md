## The Problem Docker Solves

"It works on my machine" is the punchline every developer dreads. Your app runs locally, but staging or production breaks because the environment differs — wrong Node version, a missing library, or a dependency conflict. **Docker** fixes this by packaging your application with everything it needs to run, so the same setup works on your laptop, a teammate's machine, or a cloud server.

## What Is a Hypervisor?

Before containers went mainstream, teams relied on **virtual machines** (VMs). A **hypervisor** is software that sits between physical hardware and those VMs — it carves one server into multiple isolated "computers," each running its own full operating system.

A real-world example: when you launch an EC2 instance on AWS, the **Nitro Hypervisor** (built on KVM) creates your VM. Nitro handles CPU, memory, and storage allocation while keeping the underlying host secure. You get a complete Linux environment without owning separate physical hardware.

## Container vs Virtual Machine

A **container** shares the host's OS kernel instead of booting a separate one. That trade-off makes containers lighter and faster, with slightly less isolation than a full VM.

| | Container | Virtual Machine |
|---|---|---|
| Isolation level | Process-level (shared kernel) | Hardware-level (separate OS per VM) |
| Weight / speed | Lightweight — MBs, minimal overhead | Heavy — full OS per instance, GBs of disk |
| Startup time | Seconds or less | Minutes (full boot cycle) |
| Portability | Runs anywhere Docker is installed | Requires matching hypervisor and OS image |

## What Docker Actually Is

**Docker** is a platform for building, shipping, and running applications inside containers. You write a **Dockerfile** describing your app, Docker builds a portable **image** from it, and you run that image as a **container** — a live, isolated process on any machine with Docker installed.

> **Key Takeaway**
> Docker eliminates "works on my machine" by bundling apps into portable containers that behave the same everywhere. VMs offer stronger isolation with full OS copies; containers trade some of that for speed and efficiency. For most application workloads, Docker is the practical sweet spot.
