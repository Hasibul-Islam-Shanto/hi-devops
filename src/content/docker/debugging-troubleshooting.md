## Container Exit Codes and States

| Code / state | Meaning | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| **Exited (0)** | Process finished normally | Expected for one-off jobs |
| **Exited (1)** | General error — app crashed | Check logs, then `docker exec` in |
| **Exited (126)** | Command not executable | Verify CMD path and permissions |
| **Exited (127)** | Command not found in image | Check CMD spelling and install path |
| **Restarting** | Crash loop — process exits immediately | Read logs for bad config or missing dependency |
| **Unhealthy** | Healthcheck failing | Run the healthcheck command manually inside |

## Key Debugging Commands

| Command | What it tells you | When to use it |
|---|---|---|
| `docker ps -a` | All containers with status and exit codes | First look at what's running or stopped |
| `docker logs -f <container>` | Live stdout/stderr | Crashes, errors, unexpected behaviour |
| `docker exec -it <container> sh` | Shell inside a running container | Reproduce errors, inspect files |
| `docker inspect <container>` | Full config — env, mounts, network, ports | Misconfiguration with no obvious log error |
| `docker inspect --format '{{json .State}}' <container>` | State block only — exit code, OOM | Quick state check |
| `docker stats` | Live CPU, memory, network usage | Resource starvation under load |
| `docker compose logs -f <service>` | Logs for a Compose service | Multi-container stacks |
| `docker network inspect <network>` | Containers on a network and their IPs | Services cannot reach each other |
| `docker build --no-cache --progress=plain .` | Full rebuild output, no cache | Suspect a stale cached layer |
| `docker inspect <container> --format='{{.State.OOMKilled}}'` | Whether killed for out-of-memory | Container dies silently under load |
| `docker exec -it <container> nc -zv <host> <port>` | TCP connectivity test | Network or DNS issues between services |
| `docker ps -q \| wc -l` | Count of running containers | Quick sanity check |

## If This, Then That

- **Container keeps restarting** → `docker logs -f <container>`, then check env vars with `docker inspect`.
- **App unreachable from browser** → confirm port mapping in `docker ps`, test from inside with `nc -zv localhost <port>`.
- **Service cannot reach database** → `docker network inspect <network>`, then `nc -zv database 5432` by service name.
- **Build fails in CI but works locally** → `docker build --no-cache --progress=plain .`
- **Container dies under load** → `docker stats`, then check `OOMKilled` via inspect.
- **Healthcheck shows Unhealthy** → read logs, exec in, run the healthcheck command manually.

> **Key Takeaway**
> Start with `docker ps -a` and `docker logs` — most problems show up in the output. Reach for `inspect`, `exec`, and `stats` when logs are not enough.
