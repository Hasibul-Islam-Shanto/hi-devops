## What Is a Dockerfile?

A **Dockerfile** is a plain text file that lists step-by-step instructions for building a Docker image — think of it as a recipe your app follows every time you build. Docker reads it top to bottom; each instruction typically creates a new image layer that gets cached for faster rebuilds.

## Dockerfile vs Docker Image

The **Dockerfile** is the blueprint; the **Docker image** is the finished product built from that blueprint. You write the Dockerfile once, run `docker build`, and Docker produces a reusable image you can run as many containers as you need.

## A Simple Node.js Dockerfile

Here is a realistic Dockerfile for a small Express API — notice how dependency files are copied before source code so Docker can cache the `npm ci` layer:

```dockerfile
FROM node:22-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./
RUN npm ci --omit=dev
COPY . .
ENV NODE_ENV=production
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["node", "server.js"]
```

## All 15 Dockerfile Instructions

Every instruction below is something you will encounter in real Dockerfiles. Each entry covers what it does, a minimal example, and a practical note.

| # | Instruction | What it does | Example | Practical note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **FROM** | Starts the image; downloads the base if not available locally | `FROM ubuntu:22.04` | Required — every Dockerfile must begin with `FROM` |
| 2 | **LABEL** | Adds metadata (author, version, project, description) | `LABEL maintainer="you@example.com"` | Useful for documentation and image management tools |
| 3 | **ARG** | Build-time variable — available only during `docker build` | `ARG VERSION=1.0` | Override with `docker build --build-arg VERSION=2.0 .` |
| 4 | **ENV** | Sets environment variables for build **and** runtime | `ENV APP_ENV=production` | Your app reads these via `process.env` or equivalent |
| 5 | **WORKDIR** | Sets the working directory; creates it if missing | `WORKDIR /app` | All following commands execute from this path |
| 6 | **COPY** | Copies local files into the image | `COPY app.py /app/` | Default choice — simple, predictable, no remote URLs |
| 7 | **ADD** | Like `COPY`, plus auto-extracts tar archives and fetches URLs | `ADD app.tar.gz /app/` | Prefer `COPY` unless you need extraction or a remote file |
| 8 | **RUN** | Executes a command during the build; creates a new layer | `RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y nginx` | Use for installing packages, compiling, or any setup step |
| 9 | **EXPOSE** | Documents which port the app listens on | `EXPOSE 8080` | Does **not** publish the port — you still need `docker run -p 8080:8080` |
| 10 | **VOLUME** | Declares a mount point for persistent data | `VOLUME /data` | Data here survives container recreation — good for DBs, logs, uploads |
| 11 | **USER** | Runs subsequent commands as a non-root user | `USER appuser` | Improves security — avoid running as root in production |
| 12 | **HEALTHCHECK** | Defines how Docker checks if the app is healthy | `HEALTHCHECK CMD curl --fail http://localhost:8080 \|\| exit 1` | Docker reports: starting → healthy or unhealthy |
| 13 | **CMD** | Default command when a container starts | `CMD ["python", "app.py"]` | Fully overridable — `docker run image-name bash` replaces it |
| 14 | **ENTRYPOINT** | Defines the main executable; args are appended, not replaced | `ENTRYPOINT ["python"]` | See CMD vs ENTRYPOINT below |
| 15 | **ONBUILD** | Runs when this image is used as a base in another Dockerfile | `ONBUILD COPY . /app` | Useful for reusable base images that child images extend |

## Instruction Deep Dives

### FROM, LABEL, and ARG — Starting the Build

`FROM` is non-negotiable — it tells Docker which base image to extend. Pin a specific version (`node:22-alpine`) instead of `latest` so rebuilds stay predictable.

`LABEL` is optional but helpful for tagging who maintains the image, what version it represents, or what project it belongs to.

`ARG` variables exist only at build time. They are ideal for passing a version number or build flag into `RUN` commands, but they do not persist when the container runs. Use `ENV` if the value needs to survive into runtime.

### COPY vs ADD — When to Use Which

Both copy files into the image, but they are not interchangeable:

- **COPY** — copies files and directories from your build context. No surprises. Use this by default.
- **ADD** — can auto-extract a local `.tar.gz` into the destination and download files from a URL. The extra behaviour can be unexpected, which is why most teams reach for `COPY` first and only switch to `ADD` when extraction or remote download is genuinely needed.

### RUN — Building Layers

Every `RUN` instruction creates a permanent layer in the image. Chain commands with `&&` in a single `RUN` to keep layer count down:

```dockerfile
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y nginx && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```

That one line installs nginx and cleans up in a single layer instead of three.

### EXPOSE and VOLUME — Runtime Hints

`EXPOSE` is documentation, not magic. It tells humans and tools which port your app uses, but nothing is reachable from outside the container until you publish it:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 my-image
```

`VOLUME` marks a path as persistent storage managed by Docker. If a database writes to `/data` and that path is a volume, stopping and recreating the container keeps the data intact.

### CMD vs ENTRYPOINT — How Containers Start

These two instructions work together and are the most commonly confused pair in Dockerfiles.

**CMD alone** — sets the default command. Fully replaceable at run time:

```dockerfile
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

```bash
docker run myapp bash          # runs bash instead of python app.py
```

**ENTRYPOINT + CMD** — `ENTRYPOINT` locks in the executable; `CMD` supplies default arguments that `docker run` args override:

```dockerfile
ENTRYPOINT ["python"]
CMD ["app.py"]
```

```bash
docker run myapp               # runs: python app.py
docker run myapp test.py       # runs: python test.py
```

Use `ENTRYPOINT` when the container should always run the same binary (a CLI tool, a server process). Use `CMD` alone when you want flexibility to override the entire command at run time.

### HEALTHCHECK — Knowing When Apps Fail

A healthcheck gives Docker a way to detect a running but broken app — one that started successfully but stopped responding:

```dockerfile
HEALTHCHECK CMD curl --fail http://localhost:8080 || exit 1
```

Docker cycles through three states: **starting** (waiting for first check), **healthy** (check passed), and **unhealthy** (check failed). Orchestrators like Compose and Kubernetes use this to restart or reroute traffic away from failing containers.

### ONBUILD — Base Images That Trigger on Extend

`ONBUILD` instructions do not run when you build the base image. They run when someone else uses your image as their `FROM`:

```dockerfile
# In a base image Dockerfile:
ONBUILD COPY . /app
```

This pattern is common in language base images that expect the child Dockerfile to supply the application code.

## Quick Reference

| Instruction | Purpose | Instruction | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| **FROM** | Base image | **EXPOSE** | Document application port |
| **LABEL** | Metadata | **VOLUME** | Persistent storage |
| **ENV** | Environment variables | **USER** | Run as non-root user |
| **WORKDIR** | Working directory | **HEALTHCHECK** | Check container health |
| **COPY** | Copy local files | **CMD** | Default startup command |
| **ADD** | Copy + extract archives | **ENTRYPOINT** | Main executable |
| **RUN** | Execute build commands | **ARG** | Build-time variable |
| | | **ONBUILD** | Trigger for child images |

## Best Practices

- Use a minimal base image — Alpine, Debian-slim, or distroless keep images small and reduce attack surface.
- Combine multiple `RUN` commands with `&&` in a single instruction to reduce layer count.
- Add a `.dockerignore` file to exclude `node_modules`, `.git`, and other files that bloat the build context.
- Prefer **COPY** over **ADD** unless you specifically need archive extraction or a remote URL.
- Run containers as a non-root **USER** whenever possible.
- Pin image versions — `python:3.12-slim` instead of `latest` — so builds stay reproducible across machines and CI.
- Place frequently changing instructions (like `COPY . .`) near the end of the Dockerfile to maximise build cache hits.
- Use multi-stage builds to keep compilers and build tools out of your production image.
- Add a **HEALTHCHECK** for production workloads so Docker can detect and report failing apps.
- Scan your Dockerfile for best-practice violations, and never hard-code secrets — pass them at run time via environment variables or a secrets manager.

> **Key Takeaway**
> A Dockerfile is a layered recipe read top to bottom: **FROM** picks your base, **COPY** and **RUN** assemble the app, **EXPOSE** and **ENV** document runtime config, and **CMD** or **ENTRYPOINT** start the process. Know all 15 instructions, understand when to use each, and follow the best practices to build images that are small, secure, and fast to rebuild.
