In this project, I deployed a simple full-stack application on Kubernetes using **kind**.

The application has three main parts:

- **Frontend**: React/Vite application served by Nginx
- **Backend**: Node.js API application
- **Database**: PostgreSQL running inside the Kubernetes cluster

The frontend and backend images are pulled from Docker Hub, while PostgreSQL runs directly as a Kubernetes workload with persistent storage.

## Final Architecture

The final deployment looks like this:

```text
                         Internet
                            |
                            | EC2_PUBLIC_IP:8080
                            v
                      AWS EC2 Host
                            |

                            |
                    Host 8080 -> 30080
                            |
                            v

                    +-------+--------+
                            |
                            v
                      PostgreSQL Pod
                           :5432
                            |
                            v
                      postgres-pvc
                            |
                            v
                     PersistentVolume
```

## Project Structure

I organized the Kubernetes files like this:

```text
incident-k8s/
|
├── kind-config.yml
├── namespace.yml
|
├── postgres-secret.yml
├── postgres-pvc.yml
├── postgres-deployment.yml
├── postgres-service.yml
|
├── backend-deployment.yml
├── backend-service.yml
|
├── frontend-deployment.yml
└── frontend-service.yml
```

Each file has one specific responsibility. That makes the deployment easier to reason about and debug.

## Creating the kind Cluster

The first file is `kind-config.yml`. This creates the Kubernetes cluster using kind, which means the Kubernetes nodes run as Docker containers.

```yaml
kind: Cluster
apiVersion: kind.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4

nodes:
  - role: control-plane
    extraPortMappings:
      - containerPort: 30080
        hostPort: 8080
        listenAddress: "0.0.0.0"
        protocol: TCP

      - containerPort: 30081
        hostPort: 8081
        listenAddress: "0.0.0.0"
        protocol: TCP

  - role: worker

  - role: worker
```

From the EC2/Docker perspective, kind creates Docker containers:

```text
AWS EC2
   |
   +-- Docker
        |
        +-- incident-control-plane
        +-- incident-worker
        +-- incident-worker2
```

But from the Kubernetes perspective, those containers are nodes:

```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

The important part is the port mapping:

```text
EC2 :8080 -> kind :30080
EC2 :8081 -> kind :30081
```

Port `30080` is used by the frontend NodePort service. Port `30081` is used by the backend NodePort service.

Create the cluster with:

```bash
kind create cluster --name incident --config kind-config.yml
```

`kind-config.yml` is not a Kubernetes manifest. It is configuration consumed by kind before Kubernetes resources are applied.

## Creating the Namespace

The namespace creates a logical boundary for all resources that belong to this application.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace

metadata:
  name: incident
```

Apply it:

```bash
kubectl apply -f namespace.yml
```

After this, every manifest uses:

```yaml
metadata:
  namespace: incident
```

Conceptually, the namespace contains:

```text
incident
|
├── PostgreSQL
├── Backend
└── Frontend
```

## Creating the PostgreSQL Secret

PostgreSQL requires database credentials. Instead of putting them directly inside the Deployment, I used a Kubernetes Secret.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret

metadata:
  name: postgres-secret
  namespace: incident

type: Opaque

stringData:
  POSTGRES_USER: incident_user
  POSTGRES_PASSWORD: incident_password
  POSTGRES_DB: incident_db
```

This provides:

- `POSTGRES_USER`
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`
- `POSTGRES_DB`

The PostgreSQL container reads these values when it starts. The backend also reuses the same Secret for its database configuration.

```text
postgres-secret
       |
       +----------------+
       v                v
PostgreSQL Pod     Backend Pods
```

For a learning environment, this is fine. In a real production setup, secrets should be handled more carefully, and real credentials should not be committed to Git.

## Creating Persistent Storage

Containers are temporary. If PostgreSQL stores everything only inside the container filesystem, data can be lost when the container is removed or recreated.

```text
Postgres Pod deleted
        |
        v
Container deleted
        |
        v
Database data potentially lost
```

So I created a `PersistentVolumeClaim`.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim

metadata:
  name: postgres-pvc
  namespace: incident

spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce

  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
```

The PVC requests `1Gi` of persistent storage.

```text
PostgreSQL Pod
      |
      | mount
      v
postgres-pvc
      |
      v
PersistentVolume
```

At first, the PVC can appear as `Pending`. In kind, the default StorageClass may use:

```text
WaitForFirstConsumer
```

That means Kubernetes waits until a Pod actually needs the volume before provisioning and binding it.

```text
PVC created
   |
   v
Pending
   |
   v
Postgres Pod scheduled
   |
   v
Volume provisioned
   |
   v
PVC Bound
```

## Deploying PostgreSQL

Now we can create PostgreSQL itself.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment

metadata:
  name: postgres
  namespace: incident

spec:
  replicas: 1

  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: postgres

  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: postgres

    spec:
      containers:
        - name: postgres
          image: postgres:16

          ports:
            - containerPort: 5432

          env:
            - name: POSTGRES_USER
              valueFrom:
                secretKeyRef:
                  name: postgres-secret
                  key: POSTGRES_USER

            - name: POSTGRES_PASSWORD
              valueFrom:
                secretKeyRef:
                  name: postgres-secret
                  key: POSTGRES_PASSWORD

            - name: POSTGRES_DB
              valueFrom:
                secretKeyRef:
                  name: postgres-secret
                  key: POSTGRES_DB

          volumeMounts:
            - name: postgres-storage
              mountPath: /var/lib/postgresql/data

      volumes:
        - name: postgres-storage
          persistentVolumeClaim:
            claimName: postgres-pvc
```

This connects three things:

```text
postgres-secret
       |
       | credentials
       v
PostgreSQL Pod
       |
       | database files
       v
postgres-pvc
```

The PostgreSQL container listens on port `5432`, and its database files are stored under:

```text
/var/lib/postgresql/data
```

That path is mounted to the PVC, so the data can survive Pod restarts and replacements.

## Creating the PostgreSQL Service

The PostgreSQL Pod has its own Pod IP, but the backend should never depend on that IP. Pods can be recreated, and their IPs can change.

So I created a stable Service:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service

metadata:
  name: postgres-service
  namespace: incident

spec:
  type: ClusterIP

  selector:
    app: postgres

  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 5432
      targetPort: 5432
```

The Service finds the PostgreSQL Pod using this selector:

```yaml
selector:
  app: postgres
```

That works because the Pod template has this label:

```yaml
labels:
  app: postgres
```

The relationship is:

```text
postgres-service
       |
       | selector: app=postgres
       v
PostgreSQL Pod
```

I used `ClusterIP` because PostgreSQL only needs to be reachable from inside the Kubernetes cluster. There is no reason to expose the database directly to the internet.

The backend can now connect to:

```text
postgres-service:5432
```

instead of knowing the PostgreSQL Pod IP.

## Deploying the Backend

The backend Docker image is:

```text
shanto78/incident-backend:latest
```

The Deployment creates two backend replicas.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment

metadata:
  name: incident-backend
  namespace: incident

spec:
  replicas: 2

  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: incident-backend

  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: incident-backend

    spec:
      containers:
        - name: incident-backend
          image: shanto78/incident-backend:latest

          ports:
            - containerPort: 5000

          env:
            - name: PORT
              value: "5000"

            - name: NODE_ENV
              value: "production"

            - name: DB_HOST
              value: "postgres-service"

            - name: DB_PORT
              value: "5432"

            - name: DB_NAME
              valueFrom:
                secretKeyRef:
                  name: postgres-secret
                  key: POSTGRES_DB

            - name: DB_USER
              valueFrom:
                secretKeyRef:
                  name: postgres-secret
                  key: POSTGRES_USER

            - name: DB_PASSWORD
              valueFrom:
                secretKeyRef:
                  name: postgres-secret
                  key: POSTGRES_PASSWORD
```

The most important configuration is:

```text
DB_HOST=postgres-service
DB_PORT=5432
```

In Docker Compose, I previously used:

```text
DB_HOST=database
```

because `database` was the Docker Compose service name.

In Kubernetes, the equivalent stable name is the Service name:

```text
Docker Compose       Kubernetes
database       ->     postgres-service
```

CoreDNS allows the backend Pods to resolve that Service name.

```text
incident-backend Deployment
           |
           v
       ReplicaSet
           |
      replicas: 2
           |
     +-----+-----+
     v           v
Backend Pod   Backend Pod
   :5000         :5000
```

## Creating the Backend Service

The two backend Pods need one stable endpoint.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service

metadata:
  name: backend-service
  namespace: incident

spec:
  type: NodePort

  selector:
    app: incident-backend

  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 5000
      targetPort: 5000
      nodePort: 30081
```

The Service finds Pods labeled:

```text
app=incident-backend
```

so both backend Pods become Service endpoints.

```text
              backend-service
                   :5000
                     |
             selector:
          app=incident-backend
                     |
              +------+------+
              v             v
         Backend Pod    Backend Pod
            :5000          :5000
```

Because the Service uses:

```yaml
nodePort: 30081
```

and kind maps:

```text
EC2 8081 -> kind 30081
```

the backend can be reached externally during testing:

```text
EC2_PUBLIC_IP:8081
       |
       v
NodePort :30081
       |
       v
backend-service :5000
       |
       v
Backend Pod :5000
```

This external backend exposure is useful for learning and testing. The frontend reverse proxy does not require browser traffic to access the backend directly.

## Configuring Frontend Nginx

The frontend is a static application served through Nginx. Its Docker image includes an Nginx configuration like this:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name _;

    root /usr/share/nginx/html;
    index index.html;

    location /api/ {
        proxy_pass http://backend-service:5000/api/;

        proxy_http_version 1.1;

        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
    }
}
```

This is an important part of the architecture.

Requests for `/` serve the frontend. Requests for `/api/*` are proxied to:

```text
backend-service:5000
```

So the flow becomes:

```text
Browser
   |
   | /api/incidents
   v
Frontend Nginx
   |
   | backend-service:5000/api/incidents
   v
Backend Service
   |
   v
Backend Pod
```

The browser never needs to understand Kubernetes DNS. Nginx is running inside the cluster, so it can resolve `backend-service` through CoreDNS.

## Deploying the Frontend

The frontend Docker image is:

```text
shanto78/incident-frontend:latest
```

The frontend Deployment also runs two replicas.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment

metadata:
  name: incident-frontend
  namespace: incident

spec:
  replicas: 2

  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: incident-frontend

  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: incident-frontend

    spec:
      containers:
        - name: incident-frontend
          image: shanto78/incident-frontend:latest

          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
```

Nginx runs inside each frontend Pod and serves the built frontend files.

```text
Deployment
    |
    v
ReplicaSet
    |
+---+----------+
|              |
v              v
Frontend     Frontend
Pod 1        Pod 2
:80          :80
```

## Creating the Frontend Service

Finally, I exposed the frontend.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service

metadata:
  name: frontend-service
  namespace: incident

spec:
  type: NodePort

  selector:
    app: incident-frontend

  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
      nodePort: 30080
```

The Service finds frontend Pods using:

```text
app=incident-frontend
```

```text
frontend-service
       |
       | selector: app=incident-frontend
       v
 +-----+---------+
 |               |
 v               v
Frontend       Frontend
Pod 1          Pod 2
```

The kind configuration maps:

```text
EC2 :8080 -> kind :30080
```

and the Service maps:

```text
NodePort :30080 -> Service :80 -> Pod :80
```

Therefore, the complete external path is:

```text
Browser
   |
   v
EC2_PUBLIC_IP:8080
   |
   v
kind mapping 8080 -> 30080
   |
   v
frontend-service
   |
   v
Frontend Pod
```

## Complete Request Flow

When a user opens:

```text
http://EC2_PUBLIC_IP:8080
```

the frontend request follows this path:

```text
Browser
   |
   v
EC2 :8080
   |
   v
kind port mapping
   |
   v
NodePort :30080
   |
   v
frontend-service
   |
   v
Frontend Nginx Pod
   |
   v
index.html / JS / CSS
   |
   v
Browser
```

Now suppose the frontend requests:

```text
/api/incidents
```

The request becomes:

```text
Browser
   |
   | /api/incidents
   v
EC2 :8080
   |
   v
frontend-service
   |
   v
Frontend Nginx Pod
   |
   | proxy_pass
   v
backend-service:5000
   |
   | CoreDNS resolves Service
   v
Backend Pod
   |
   | SQL query
   v
postgres-service:5432
   |
   | CoreDNS resolves Service
   v
PostgreSQL Pod
   |
   v
Database
```

The response travels back through the same chain:

```text
PostgreSQL
   |
   v
Backend
   |
   v
Frontend Nginx
   |
   v
Browser
```

That is the full request lifecycle of the deployed application.

## Deployment Order

For a completely fresh environment, I used this order:

```bash
# 1. Cluster
kind create cluster --name incident --config kind-config.yml

# 2. Namespace
kubectl apply -f namespace.yml

# 3. PostgreSQL configuration/storage
kubectl apply -f postgres-secret.yml
kubectl apply -f postgres-pvc.yml

# 4. PostgreSQL
kubectl apply -f postgres-deployment.yml
kubectl apply -f postgres-service.yml

# 5. Backend
kubectl apply -f backend-deployment.yml
kubectl apply -f backend-service.yml

# 6. Frontend
kubectl apply -f frontend-deployment.yml
kubectl apply -f frontend-service.yml
```

Conceptually:

```text
Cluster
   |
   v
Namespace
   |
   v
Secrets + Storage
   |
   v
Database
   |
   v
Database Service
   |
   v
Backend
   |
   v
Backend Service
   |
   v
Frontend
   |
   v
Frontend Service
   |
   v
Application accessible
```

## Useful Verification Commands

During deployment, these are the commands worth remembering:

```bash
# Everything in the namespace
kubectl get all -n incident

# Pods
kubectl get pods -n incident -o wide

# Deployments
kubectl get deployments -n incident

## Debugging Lessons

One useful lesson from this deployment was knowing which command to reach for based on the failure mode.

If the Pod is `Running`, but the application is failing:

```text
Pod Running but application failing
        |
        v
kubectl logs
```

If the Pod shows `CreateContainerConfigError`:

```text
CreateContainerConfigError
        |
        v
kubectl describe pod
        |
        v
Check Events
```

If the Pod shows `ErrImagePull`:

```text
ErrImagePull
        |
        v
kubectl describe pod
        |
        v
Check image/tag/platform
```

I encountered both configuration and image-platform issues during this deployment, so these were not just theoretical troubleshooting steps.

## Final Thoughts

This deployment helped connect several Kubernetes concepts together:

- A kind cluster can expose NodePorts through Docker port mappings.
- Deployments manage replicas through ReplicaSets.
- Services provide stable network names for changing Pods.
- CoreDNS allows applications to communicate using Service names.
- PVCs keep database storage separate from the PostgreSQL container lifecycle.
- Nginx can act as the frontend server and internal API reverse proxy.

The most important mindset shift was moving from "container names" in Docker Compose to "Service names" in Kubernetes. Once that clicked, the full-stack request flow became much easier to understand.
